Neovim Configuration :] 

Issues - 
 - [ ] symbols outline is not working; it has functions that are deprecated, either I need to patch the plugin or choose between a fork of this plugin or a different plugin entirely, LSP is minimal for linting and symbol finding.
 - [ ] leetcode nvim plugin; have not tested yet.
